## QUIZ 8

*Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration*

I find the "double exposure" photographic imaging technique inspiring: merging two images to create a single hybrid composition. I am drawn to this technique for its ability to convey complex storytelling and emotion through the overlay of visual elements. Using Double Exposure in my assignments allows me to achieve a sense of interconnectedness and duality in the artwork I choose to create. In assignments, I can also use this imaging technique to construct multiple shadows and the overlapping of different lines or shapes.
